As outlined in the original documentation, this is solely for educational and awareness purposes. 
This ransomware was developed in 2017 and even earlier, yet many individuals and especially companies still do not take such threats seriously, 
treating them as if they only exist in movies. To address this gap in understanding, 
I am making a ransomware demonstration available on GitHub. This will help illustrate the real-world impact of such attacks. 
Itâ€™s important to emphasize that cyber threats are real and should not be ignored. 
I do not promote hacking; I am advocating for ethical hacking and responsible penetration testing.
